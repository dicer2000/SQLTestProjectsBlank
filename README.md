## Getting Started

Use this project as a starting point for your dev and testing in class.  To get started download this repository zip file or clone it into your own Visual Studio project.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2010+ with .Net 4.6.1.

To download this via a zip file, just click Clone or Download and select Download as a Zip.  Then unzip that file onto your hard drive and open it with Visual Studio.  It should be ready to go and just bring up a blank page when you run it.

If you want to use Git and clone this onto your local system, it is pretty easy.  However, you need knowledge of Git and the GitHub component installed.  Follow these steps:

- Open Visual Studio, but don't open a project or solution
- Open the Team Explorer window (usually on the right set of tabs)
- In the Connect window of Team Explorer, sign in to Github (if you don't have the GitHub plugin, Add it)
- Within the GitHub area, click "Clone" and enter the Clone Url found on this page when you click "Click or Download"
- The entire solution will be cloned to your computer and you can open it in the Solution Explorer window.
